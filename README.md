Description: In this project, I collected the past 250 entries for 10 of the top 25 etf stocks from YAHOO finance's top 25 etf stock list, using data collected by stockanalysis.com. The data collected focuses on several common columns when analyzing stocks. The columns in the data sets are Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adj. Close, Change, and Volume. This project will be extended in the future, but currently it features an alert system in which a windows notification will be sent if the Open price for one of the etf's is the lowest in the past month or highest in the past month. Additionally, this project features an automatic web scraper to update each data set. This project focuses on alerting the user of the pricing change in short term.
